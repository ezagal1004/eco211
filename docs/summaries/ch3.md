# Chapter 3: Supply and Demand

ðŸ“¥ **[Download as PDF](/pdfs/eco-211-ch3.pdf)**

## **Key Learning Objectives**
- Understand what a **competitive market** is.
- Learn about **supply and demand curves**.
- Analyze how these curves determine **equilibrium price and quantity**.
- Examine how **price movements correct shortages and surpluses**.

---

## **Competitive Markets**
- A market with **many buyers and sellers** where no single participant can influence price.
- The **Supply and Demand Model** explains how a competitive market functions.

### Five Key Elements of the Model
1. Demand Curve
2. Supply Curve
3. Factors shifting demand & supply curves
4. Market equilibrium
5. Changes in market equilibrium

## **Demand**
- Represents **buyer behavior**.
- **Demand Schedule**: Table showing quantity demanded at different prices.
- **Demand Curve**: Graphical representation of demand.
- **Law of Demand**: Higher price â†’ Lower demand (*ceteris paribus*).

### Shifts in Demand Curve
- **Increase in demand** â†’ Rightward shift.
- **Decrease in demand** â†’ Leftward shift.

#### **Movement Along vs. Shift in Demand**
- **Movement** occurs when **only price changes**.
- **Shift** occurs due to **external factors**.

### Factors That Shift Demand
1. **Prices of Related Goods**
   - **Substitutes**: If the price of one increases, demand for the other increases *(e.g., coffee & tea)*.
   - **Complements**: If the price of one decreases, demand for the other increases *(e.g., cars & gasoline)*.
2. **Income Changes**
   - **Normal goods**: Demand **increases** with income rise.
   - **Inferior goods**: Demand **decreases** with income rise.
3. **Tastes & Preferences**: **Seasonal trends, fads, and societal changes** affect demand.
4. **Expectations**: **Anticipated future price changes** influence current demand.
5. **Number of Consumers**: **Larger population** â†’ **Higher demand**.

---

## **Supply**
- Represents **seller behavior**.
- **Supply Schedule**: Table showing quantity supplied at different prices.
- **Supply Curve**: Graphical representation of supply.
- **Law of Supply**: Higher price â†’ Higher quantity supplied.

### Shifts in Supply Curve
- **Increase in supply** â†’ Rightward shift.
- **Decrease in supply** â†’ Leftward shift.

#### **Movement Along vs. Shift in Supply**
- **Movement** occurs when **price changes**.
- **Shift** occurs due to **external factors**.

### Factors That Shift Supply
1. **Input Prices**: Higher input costs â†’ **Decreased supply**.
2. **Prices of Related Goods**
   - **Substitutes in production**: Higher profitability of one good **reduces supply** of another.
   - **Complements in production**: Higher production of one good **increases supply** of another.
3. **Technology**: **Improvements increase supply**.
4. **Expectations**: **Expected future price increases** â†’ **Current supply decreases**.
5. **Number of Producers**: **More producers** â†’ **Increased supply**.

## **Market Equilibrium**
- **Equilibrium Price (Market-Clearing Price)**: Where **quantity supplied = quantity demanded**.
- **Equilibrium Quantity**: The quantity **exchanged at equilibrium price**.

### Price Adjustments in the Market
#### **Surplus (Excess Supply)**
- Occurs when **price is above equilibrium**.
- Leads to **price decrease** as sellers try to **sell excess stock**.

#### **Shortage (Excess Demand)**
- Occurs when **price is below equilibrium**.
- Leads to **price increase** as consumers **compete for limited goods**.

---

## **Shifts in Market Equilibrium**
- **Demand Increase** â†’ **Higher price & quantity**.
- **Demand Decrease** â†’ **Lower price & quantity**.
- **Supply Increase** â†’ **Lower price, higher quantity**.
- **Supply Decrease** â†’ **Higher price, lower quantity**.

### Simultaneous Shifts in Supply and Demand
- **Both Increase** â†’ **Quantity increases**, **price change depends** on relative shifts.
- **Both Decrease** â†’ **Quantity decreases**, **price change depends** on relative shifts.
- **Demand Increases, Supply Decreases** â†’ **Price rises**, **quantity change depends**.
- **Demand Decreases, Supply Increases** â†’ **Price falls**, **quantity change depends**.

   **Answer:** Demand for solar power **increases**, demand for cars **decreases**.

2. **If gasoline prices drop by 50%, what happens to car demand?**  
   **Answer:** Car demand **increases**.

3. **If garden gnomes become trendy again, what happens?**  
   **Answer:** Equilibrium price & quantity **increase**.

4. **If the cost of wood falls, what happens to violin prices?**  
   **Answer:** Price **decreases**, quantity **increases**.
