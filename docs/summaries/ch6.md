# Chapter 6: Macroeconomics - The Big Picture

üì• **[Download as PDF](/pdfs/eco-211-ch6.pdf)**

## **Key Learning Objectives**
- Understand the difference between **macroeconomics and microeconomics**.
- Learn about **business cycles** and why policymakers try to reduce their severity.
- Analyze how **long-run economic growth** affects a country‚Äôs standard of living.
- Examine **inflation and deflation**, and why price stability is preferred.
- Understand **international macroeconomics** and how economies interact through **trade deficits and surpluses**.

---

## **The Nature of Macroeconomics**
- **Macroeconomics** studies the **economy as a whole**, focusing on aggregate outcomes like total employment, inflation, and national income.
- **Microeconomics** focuses on **individual decision-making** by firms and consumers.
- Macroeconomic outcomes are **not simply the sum of microeconomic decisions**.

### Key Differences Between Micro and Macro Questions
- **Micro:** ‚ÄúShould I go to business school?‚Äù ‚Üí **Macro:** ‚ÄúHow many people are employed?‚Äù
- **Micro:** ‚ÄúWhat salary does Google offer to an MBA?‚Äù ‚Üí **Macro:** ‚ÄúWhat determines overall wage levels?‚Äù
- **Micro:** ‚ÄúShould Citibank open a new office?‚Äù ‚Üí **Macro:** ‚ÄúWhat determines global trade balances?‚Äù

## **Macroeconomics: The Whole is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts**
- **Paradox of Thrift:** If individuals **cut spending** to save money, **overall demand falls**, leading to economic downturns.
- Individual behaviors **don‚Äôt always translate** into beneficial macroeconomic outcomes.

---

## **Macroeconomic Theory and Policy**
- **Pre-1930s Economic Thought:** The economy was believed to be **self-regulating**, requiring **minimal government intervention**.
- **Post-1930s (Keynesian Economics):** Economic downturns result from **inadequate spending**, and government policies (monetary & fiscal) can stabilize the economy.

### Macroeconomic Policy Tools
1. **Monetary Policy**: Uses **money supply** adjustments to influence **interest rates and spending**.
2. **Fiscal Policy**: Uses **government spending and taxation** to influence **overall demand**.

### Historical Comparison
- **Great Depression (1930s):** Governments **let the economy self-correct**, worsening the slump.
- **Great Recession (2008):** Governments **cut interest rates, increased spending, and reduced taxes** to stabilize the economy.

---

## **The Business Cycle**
- **Business Cycle:** Alternates between **recessions (downturns)** and **expansions (recoveries)**.
- **Recession:** Period when **output and employment decline**.
- **Expansion:** Period when **output and employment rise**.
- **Business Cycle Peak:** Highest point before a **recession**.
- **Business Cycle Trough:** Lowest point before an **expansion**.

### Effects of Recessions
- **Job losses**, lower incomes, reduced corporate profits, and increased bankruptcies.
- Policymakers aim to **minimize recession frequency and severity**.

### Smoothing the Business Cycle
- Since the **Great Depression**, economists **(Keynes, Friedman)** have recommended **policy interventions** to stabilize the economy.

---

## **Long-Run Economic Growth**
- **Sustained upward trend** in an economy‚Äôs output over time.
- **Increases the standard of living** by expanding access to goods and services.
- **Historical Perspective:**  
  - Economic growth is a **modern phenomenon** (e.g., Britain in 1650 had similar wealth levels as two centuries earlier).
  - Growth rates **vary across countries** (e.g., the U.S. overtook Britain in economic wealth after 1875).

---

## **Inflation and Deflation**
- **Inflation:** A **rise** in the overall price level.
- **Deflation:** A **fall** in the overall price level.

### Causes of Inflation and Deflation
- Inflation **rises during booms** and **falls during downturns**.
- In the **long run**, inflation is primarily driven by **money supply changes**.

### Economic Effects
- **Inflation:** Reduces **cash value**, discourages saving, and can lead to **hyperinflation**.
- **Deflation:** Increases **cash value**, discourages spending/investment, and can **deepen recessions**.
- **Price Stability** is preferred to avoid these extremes.

---

## **International Macroeconomics and Trade Balances**
- The U.S. is an **open economy**, meaning it **trades goods and services** with other nations.
- **Trade Deficit:** **Imports exceed exports**.
- **Trade Surplus:** **Exports exceed imports**.

### Determinants of Trade Balances
- **Countries with high investment spending relative to savings** run **trade deficits**.
- **Countries with low investment spending relative to savings** run **trade surpluses**.

---

## **Practice Questions**
1. **If a country‚Äôs imports are $1.2 billion and exports are $1.3 billion, what is it running?**  
   **Answer:** **Trade surplus**.

2. **What policy uses taxes and government spending to influence the economy?**  
   **Answer:** **Fiscal policy**.

3. **If the economy is booming, what happens to inflation?**  
   **Answer:** **It rises**.
