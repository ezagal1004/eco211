- Learn the four principles that govern how individual choices interact.
- Identify the three principles that illustrate economy-wide interactions.

---

## **I. Principles of Individual Choice**

### 1. Scarcity and Choice
- Resources are **scarce**, meaning there isnâ€™t enough to satisfy all wants.
- **Scarcity forces choices** about how resources are allocated.

### 2. Opportunity Cost
- The true cost of something is its **opportunity cost** (what is given up to get it).
- **Example:** Mark Zuckerberg dropping out of Harvard to start Facebook.

### 3. Marginal Analysis
- **"How much"** decisions involve comparing **marginal benefits vs. marginal costs**.
- **Marginal decision-making** means choosing to do a little more or less of an activity.

### 4. Incentives Matter
- **People respond to incentives** to make themselves better off.
- **Example:** Companies are more likely to reduce pollution if given **financial rewards** rather than just educational information.

## **II. Interaction of Individual Choices**

### 5. Gains from Trade
- **Trade** allows individuals to consume more than they otherwise could.
- **Specialization**: People focus on tasks they do best, increasing efficiency.

### 6. Markets Move Toward Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium**: No individual benefits from changing their behavior because market forces balance supply and demand.

### 7. Efficient Resource Use
- **Efficiency** occurs when an economy maximizes benefits without making others worse off.

### 8. Markets Lead to Efficiency (Most of the Time)
- Markets tend to allocate resources **efficiently**.
- However, **market failures** can occur, requiring **government intervention**.

#### **Equity vs. Efficiency**
- **Equity**: Fair distribution of resources (subjective).
- Often, achieving **greater equity reduces efficiency**.

## **III. Economy-Wide Interactions**

### 9. Spending Drives the Economy
- One personâ€™s **spending is another personâ€™s income**.
- **Recessions** occur when reduced spending leads to layoffs and declining incomes.

### 10. Government Policy Can Influence Spending
- **Recessions** occur when overall spending is too low â†’ **government may step in**.
- **Inflation** happens when spending is too high â†’ **government may intervene**.

### 11. Economic Growth Increases Living Standards
- Growth comes from **technology, resource availability, and productivity improvements**.
- Growth **benefits some more than others**, creating **winners** (e.g., tech industries) and **losers** (e.g., coal miners).
